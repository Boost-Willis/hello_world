# hello_world
First repository-that's all I know at this point

I now know how to make edits to a project without overwriting the master file.
I am learning web development as an intro to coding. It is quite fun so far. After HTML and CSS I will learn Javascript.
I will also be learning Python since it seems so helpful to learn.
